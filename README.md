# ⚙︎ vivaneiona/genkit-unstract

genkit-unstract is a Go library for extracting structured data from unstructured text. It runs multiple prompt-based extractions concurrently and merges the JSON fragments into a strongly-typed Go struct, giving you reliable, type-safe results at scale.

## Examples

```bash
# Basic example with simple prompts
just do basic run

# Advanced example with Stick templates
just do stick run
```
