## Overview

This document describes the technical architecture for our next-generation data processing pipeline designed to handle high-volume, real-time data streams.

**Project Delta Information:**
- Project Code: PROJ-DELTA-2024
- Project Name: Delta Data Pipeline
- Budget: $275,000.00 USD
- Start Date: May 15, 2024
- End Date: December 15, 2024
- Status: Design Phase
- Priority: Critical
- Project Lead: Dr. Robert Kim
- Team Size: 9 engineers

## Architecture Overview

The data pipeline will implement a modern, cloud-native architecture using event-driven microservices to ensure scalability, reliability, and real-time processing capabilities.

### Core Components

1. **Data Ingestion Layer**
   - Apache Kafka for message streaming
   - REST API endpoints for batch uploads
   - WebSocket connections for real-time data

2. **Processing Layer**
   - Apache Spark for distributed computing
   - Apache Flink for stream processing
   - Custom microservices in Go and Python

3. **Storage Layer**
   - ClickHouse for analytical queries
   - Redis for caching and session storage
   - S3 for long-term data archival

4. **API Gateway**
   - Kong for API management
   - Rate limiting and authentication
   - Load balancing and failover

## Performance Requirements

- **Throughput:** 1M+ events per second
- **Latency:** <100ms for real-time processing
- **Availability:** 99.9% uptime SLA
- **Scalability:** Auto-scaling based on load

## Security Considerations

- End-to-end encryption (TLS 1.3)
- OAuth 2.0 with PKCE for authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Data masking for sensitive information
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

## Monitoring and Observability

- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana for visualization and dashboards
- ELK stack for centralized logging
- Jaeger for distributed tracing
- Custom alerting via PagerDuty integration
