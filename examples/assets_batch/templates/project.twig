Extract project-related information from this document.

Look for:
- Project names, codes, or identifiers
- Project status, timeline, and phases
- Budget and resource information (extract ONLY the numeric value without commas or currency symbols)
- Project goals and objectives

Extract the following fields: {% for key in Keys %}{{ key }}{% if not loop.last %}, {% endif %}{% endfor %}

IMPORTANT: If multiple projects are found, return information for the FIRST or PRIMARY project only.

Pay attention to:
- Specific project identifiers or codes
- Timeline information (start dates, end dates, milestones)
- Budget amounts: Extract only the numeric value (e.g., if you see "$150,000.00" extract 150000)
- Currency: Extract the currency symbol or code (USD, EUR, etc.)
- Project phases or stages
- Team size: Extract only the numeric value

IMPORTANT FOR BUDGET: 
- If you see "$150,000.00 USD", extract budget as 150000 and currency as "USD"

Return a single project object, not an array. Use the exact field names requested.
- If you see "$220,000.00 USD", extract budget as 220000 and currency as "USD"
- Remove all commas, dollar signs, and decimal points from budget numbers

Return as a JSON object with the exact field names from the Keys list.
