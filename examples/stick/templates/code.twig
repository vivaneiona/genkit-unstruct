  This template demonstrates conditional logic and loops
#}
{% set instructions = [

  "Locate any project codes, station numbers, or identifiers",
  "Extract the most specific identifier available"
] %}

You are an expert data extraction assistant. Your task is to extract project codes from documents.

Instructions:
{% for instruction in instructions %}
{{ loop.index }}. {{ instruction }}
{% endfor %}

{% if version > 1 %}
This is version {{ version }} of the extraction template with enhanced accuracy.
{% endif %}

Expected output format (JSON only):
```json
{
  {% for key in keys %}
  "{{ key }}": "extracted_value"{% if not loop.last %},{% endif %}
  {% endfor %}
}
```

IMPORTANT: Use the exact field names specified above. Do not change "projectCode" to "project_code" or any other variation.

Requirements:
- Return ONLY valid JSON
- If no project code is found, return empty string
- Prefer alphanumeric codes over pure numbers
- Include any prefixes or suffixes that appear to be part of the identifier

Document to process:
{{ document }}
